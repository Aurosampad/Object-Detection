# Object-Detection
This repository is about a project of computer vision in the field of Object Detection using Yolo_v8 which is a pre-trained Computer Vision model.I have also used the Supervision library of Roboflow here for accessing the video.This project does a predcition of vehicles through a video feed given by the user or we can implement it for real-time estimation through our webcam.
